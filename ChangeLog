1999-03-08  Adam Fedor  <fedor@gnu.org>

	* Version 0.5.5 Released.

Sun Mar  7  5:58:00 1999  Richard Frith-Macdonald <richard@brainstorm.co.uk>

	* Source/NSView.m: Fixed error invalidating coordinates of a view.

1999-03-04  Adam Fedor  <fedor@gnu.org>

	* Testing/GNUmakefile.preamble: Remove tiff and jpeg libs.
	* Tools/GNUmakefile.preamble: Likewise (already in make package).

1999-03-01  Adam Fedor  <fedor@gnu.org>

	* Update documentation.

Wed Feb 24  8:56:00 1999  Richard Frith-Macdonald <richard@brainstorm.co.uk>

	Benhur reported oddity in cell drawing code - cells were drawing their
	backgrounds in the method to draw the frame.  Fixed this by moving
	background drawing code to the drawInterior methods - also removed
	a lot of redundant code to workaround bugs in clipping that are now
	fixed.
	* Source/NSBrowserCell.m: update drawing code.
	* Source/NSButtonCell.m: ditto.
	* Source/NSCell.m: ditto.
	* Source/NSFormCell.m: ditto.
	* Source/NSSliderCell.m: ditto.
	* Source/NSTextFieldCell.m: ditto.

Tue Feb 23 19:30:00 1999  Richard Frith-Macdonald <richard@brainstorm.co.uk>

	Practically every file - I went through all the classes that conform
	to the NSCoding protocol and checked and tidied their initWithCoder
	and encodeWithCoder methods.  In some cases they simply needed the
	method prototypes fixing, but in most the initWithCoder method
	needed modifying to retain decoded ivar objects correctly!
	No guarantees that coding/decoding is correct now - but it's
	certainly a lot better.

Tue Feb 23 15:18:00 1999  Richard Frith-Macdonald <richard@brainstorm.co.uk>

	Various files - fixed all the copyWithZone: methods where objects are
	both copied AND retained.

1999-02-22  Adam Fedor  <fedor@gnu.org>

	* Version: update version.

Mon Feb 22  5:52:00 1999  Richard Frith-Macdonald <richard@brainstorm.co.uk>

	character change to fix a redisplay problem - already in the main
	cvs branch.
	Also merged in changes to coordinate conversion code.

Sun Feb 21 14:43:57 1999  Masatake Yamato  <masata-y@is.aist-nara.ac.jp>

	* Panels/GNUmakefile (before-uninstall): Use -d instead of -e.
        test command in sh of solaris2.6 doesn't support -e option.

Fri Feb 19 20:00:00 1999  Richard Frith-Macdonald <richard@brainstorm.co.uk>

Thu Feb 18 13:12:00 1999  Richard Frith-Macdonald <richard@brainstorm.co.uk>

	* Headers/AppKit/NSView.h: Listed all private methods allong with
	a warning that they shouldn't be overridden.  Removed a couple of
	unused ivars.  Added two new ivars - a cache for the visible rectangle
	and a flag to say whether it (and when we add it, a matrix to map
	to and from window coordinates) is currently valid.
	Added ([-_invalidateCoordinates]) method declaration.
	* Source/NSView.m: Much tidying up. Added ([-__invalidateCoordinates]).
	Modified ([-visibleRect]) to cache the visible rect and to clip the
	invalid rect.  Speeded up iterations over all subviews etc.
	Fix error in redisplay causing occasional excess redisplay.
	* Source/NSSplitView.m: Corrected orientation of dividers.
	* Source/NSBrowser.m: Tidied  - use setNeedsDisplay.
	* Source/NSBrowserCell.m: Tidied and fixed bugs in decoding.
	* Source/NSCell.m: Tidied and fixed bugs in decoding and setting
	editable/selectable status.
	* Source/NSScroller.m: Tidy a little.

Thu Feb 18 1999  Felipe A. Rodriguez  <farz@mindspring.com>

	* NSView.m display: fix for display bug in buttons example 
	* NSCell.m endEditing: fix for display bug in buttons example 
	* NSTextField.m textShouldEndEditing: The changes to these three classes
    fix a display bug visible in the buttons example when the top text field is 
    selected for editing and then asked to resign when the user clicks on say 
    the bottom text field.  This causes a rect encompassing both views to be 
    invalidated and displayed.  Beyond being inefficient this also causes a 
    display glitch given the current drawing methodology.

Wed Feb 17 11:50:00 1999  Richard Frith-Macdonald <richard@brainstorm.co.uk>

	* Source/NSView.m: Tidyup - visibleRect is empty if we have no window.
