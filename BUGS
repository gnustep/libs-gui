Bugs in the GUI library
=======================

   * There have been a lot of improvements in the NSText code, but is
     particularly complex. It is somewhat usable though.  We hope to
     keep improving it.

   * There are problems with alpha composing.  To avoid these problems,
     you may set manually the background color of your image when
     displaying it.

   * alpha drawing and compositing of graphics works, but only to a
     limited degree.


   The following classes are currently unimplemented or unfinished to
such a degree to be unusable.

   * NSDataLink

   * NSHelpPanel

   * NSPageLayout

   * NSPrintPanel
