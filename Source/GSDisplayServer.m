  <p>This is an abstract class which provides a framework for a device
  independant window server. A window server handles the very basic control
  of the computer display and input. This includes basic window
  creation and handling, event handling, cursors, and providing
  miscellaneous information about the display.
  </p>
  
  <p>Typically a backend library will provide a concrete subclass
  which implements the device specific methods described below.
  </p>

  <p>In almost all cases, you should not call these methods directly
  in an application. You should use the equivalent methods available
  elsewhere in the library (e.g. NSWindow, NSScreen, etc).

    used with GSDisplayServer is.

   GSDisplayName is window server specific and shouldn't be used when
   creating a GSDisplayServer (although you can retrieve the value with
   the -attributes method). On X-Windows the value might be set to something
   like "host:d.s" where host is the host name, d is the display number and
   s is the screen number. GSDisplayNumber indicates the number of the
   display to open. GSScreenNumber indicates the number of the screen to
   display on. If not explicitly set, these attributes may be taked from
   environment variables or from other operating specific information.
   </p>
    <p>In almost all applications one would only create a
    single instance of a window server. Although it is possible, it is
    unlikely that you would need more than one window server (and you
    would have to be very careful how you handled window creation and
