This is version 0.8.0 of the GNUstep GUI library (`gnustep-gui').

What is the GNUstep GUI Library?
================================

   It is a library of graphical user interface classes written
completely in the Objective-C language; the classes are based upon the
OpenStep specification as release by NeXT Software, Inc.  The library
has been enhanced in a number of ways to take advantage of the GNU
system.  These classes include graphical objects such as buttons, text
fields, popup lists, browser lists, and windows; there are also many
associated classes for handling events, colors, fonts, pasteboards and
images.

   The GNUstep GUI Library is designed in two parts.  The first part is
the front-end component which is independent of platform and display
system.  This front-end is combined with a back-end component which
handles all of the display system dependent such as specific calls to
X/Windows.  This design allows the GNUstep applications to have the
"look and feel" of the underlying display system without any changes to
the application, and the library can be easily ported to other display
systems.

   The GNUstep GUI Library requires the GNU Objective-C compiler, the
GNUstep Base Library, the TIFF Graphics library, and a back-end
component like the GNUstep 'Back' Backend.

Noteworthy changes in version `0.8.0'
=====================================

Since the last stable version, the graphics/window interface was
completely revamped. Window functions were split into a separate
class, GSDisplayServer, and many PS and DPS functions were removed
that were never implemented. However, new functionality was added to
make things faster and eventually implement Quartz compatibility.

   In addition, the old backends, xgps and xdps were depreciated in
favor of a new backend, simply named back, which can be configured for a
variety of window server and graphics implementations, and also allow
for improved code sharing.

   In addition there is now a window server backend for Windows
computers, although it is in a very alpha state.

   * Wheel color picker, standard color picker (bundles) added.

   * Better autolayout with GSTable and subclasses.

   * NSOutlineView.

   * Scroll wheel support.

   * Fully-functional keybindings, including multi-stroke keybindings.

   * Memory panel available from Info Panel.

Where can you get it?  How can you compile it?
==============================================

   The gstep-gui-0.8.0.tar.gz distribution file has been placed on
`ftp.gnustep.org' in `pub/gnustep/core'.

   the TIFF Graphics library version 3.4 is required.

   It also requires a FoundationKit library as specified by the OpenStep
specification.  The FoundationKit libraries known to work are the
GNUstep Base Library.

Where do I send bug reports?

   Bug reports can be sent to <bug-gnustep@gnu.org>.
