This manual documents some configuration and installation issues
with the GNUstep GUI Library and also differences between the GUI
Library and libraries that implement the OpenStep AppKit specification
and the MacOS-X AppKit implementation.

@section Overview

The GNUstep GUI Library is a library of objects useful for writing
graphical applications.  For example, it includes classes for drawing
and manipulating graphics objects on the screen: windows, menus,
buttons, sliders, text fields, and events.  There are also many
peripheral classes that offer operating-system-independent interfaces to
images, cursors, colors, fonts, pasteboards, printing.  There are also
workspace support classes such as data links, open/save panels,
context-dependent help, spell checking.

It provides functionality that aims to implement the @samp{AppKit}
portion of the OpenStep / Cocoa API.  However the implementation has
been written to take advantage of GNUstep enhancements wherever possible.

The GNUstep GUI Library is divided into a front and back-end.  The
front-end contains the majority of implementation, but leaves out the
low-level drawing and event code.  Different back-ends will make GNUstep
available on various platforms.  The default GNU back-end currently runs
on top of the X Window System and uses only Xlib calls for
graphics. Another backend uses a Display Postscript Server for graphics.
Much work will be saved by this clean separation between front and
back-end, because it allows different platforms to share the large
amount of front-end code. Documentation for how the individual backends
work is coverered in a separate document.

The backend is divided into two parts: graphical and event handling. The
graphical portion renders the widgets based on code in the AppKit/GUI
framework.  The events portion processes the events from mouse and
keyboard input.  Both portions are operating system / environment
specific.

The backends supported by GNUstep currently are:
@table @command

@item Cairo
The Cairo backend uses the more postscript like rendering of the cairo
graphics library (available from opendesktop.org) to render.

@item Win32 / GDI
This backend uses GDI to render the widgets.

@item Wayland
This backend uses the Wayland display technology to render.  This is
an expermental backend at present.

@item Art
The art backend uses libart (the LGPL version) to render the widgets.
This backend is deprecated.

@item Xlib
The Xlib backend is the bare X11 backend that uses primitive calls to
render the objects.  This backend is deprecated.

@end table

In general, GNUstep GUI can theoretically be used on any system on which
you can build a backend.  Currently, you can build on most UNIX systems
(not Darwin, currently) as well as Windows under MSYS2 and MSVC.

@section Implementation Details

Following are some implementation details of the GUI library. These will
mostly be of interest to developers of the GUI library itself.

@subsection Drag and Drop

The drag types info for each view is kept in a global map table (protected by
locks) and can be accessed by the backend library using the function -

@smallexample
NSArray *GSGetDragTypes(Nsview *aView);
@end smallexample

Drag type information for each window (a union of the drag type info for all
the views in the window) is maintained in the graphics context.
The backend can get this information (as a counted set) using -

@smallexample
- (NSCountedSet*) _dragTypesForWindow: (int)winNum;
@end smallexample

Whenever a DnD aware view is added to, or removed from a window, the type
information for that view is added to/removed from the type information
for the window, altering the counted set.  If the alteration results in a
change in the types for the window, the method making the change returns YES.

@smallexample
- (BOOL) _addDragTypes: (NSArray*)types toWindow: (int)winNum;
- (BOOL) _removeDragTypes: (NSArray*)types fromWindow: (int)winNum;
@end smallexample

The backend library should therefore override these methods and call 'super'
to handle the update.  If the call to the super method returns YES, the
backend should make any changes as appropriate (in the case of the xdnd
protocol this means altering the XdndAware property of the X window).

You will notice that these methods use the integer window number rather
than the NSWindow object - this is for the convenience of the backend
library which should (eventually) use window numbers for everything

@subsection Theming

GNUstep implements Theming via the GSTheme class.  This class can be subclassed
to override the existing drawing being done by the widgets.  Each widget has
a category in this class in which the drawing for that widget is done. There are
two types of theme: code and non-code...

@table @command

@item Code
Code themes, for example, the WinUXTheme, use code to override specific things in
the GSTheme class so that the theme can display using the native widgets.  These
can be combined with custom widgets as well as color and image settings.

@item Non-code
Non-code themes use .plist files (which can also be used in code based themes) to
override standard images and color settings in GNUstep.

@end table

Theming is extremely flexible.  GNUstep can be made to blend into most environments.
The application to modify themes is called Thematic.

You can set the theme using the follow command:

@example
defaults write NSGlobalDomain GSTheme THEMENAME
@end example

Where THEMENAME is the name of the theme installed.  The locations for themes are:

@table @samp

@item PREFIX/System/Library/Themes
System themes

@item PREFIX/Local/Library/Themes
Locally installed themes

@item ~/GNUstep/Library/Themes
User installed themes

@end table

Where PREFIX is whatever prefix that was specified when building GNUstep. Usually
this is /usr/GNUstep, /usr/local/GNUstep, or /.

@subsection NSWorkspace

Here is (I think) the current state of the code (largely untested) -

The make_services tool examines all applications (anything with a .app,
.debug, or .profile suffix) in the system, local, and user Apps Directories.

In addition to the cache of services information, it builds a cache of
information about known applications (including information about file types
they handle).

NSWorkspace reads the cache and uses it to determine which application to use
to open a document and which icon to use to represent that document.

The NSWorkspace API has been extended to provide methods for finding/setting
the preferred icon/application for a particular file type.  NSWorkspace will
use the 'best' icon/application available.

To determine the executable to launch, if there was an
Info-gnustep.plist/Info.plist in the app wrapper and it had an
NSExecutable field - use that name.  Otherwise, try to use the name of
the app - eg. foo.app/foo The executable is launched by NSTask, which
handles the addition of machine/os/library path components as necessary.

To determine the icon for a file, use the value from the cache of icons
for the file extension, or use an 'unknown' icon.

To determine the icon for a folder, if the folder has a '.app', '.debug'
or '.profile' extension - examine the Info.plist file for an 'NSIcon'
value and try to use that.  If there is no value specified - try
foo.app/foo.tiff' or 'foo.app/.dir.tiff'

If the folder was not an application wrapper, just try the .dir.tiff file.

If no icon was available, use a default folder icon or a special icon for the
root directory.

The information about what file types an app can handle needs to be in
the MacOS-X format in the Info-gnustep.plist/Info.plist for the app -
see
@url{http://developer.apple.com/techpubs/macosxserver/System/Documentation/Developer/YellowBox/ReleaseNotes/InfoPlist.html}.

In the NSTypes fields, I used NSIcon (the icon to use for the type)
NSUnixExtensions (a list of file extensions corresponding to the type)
and NSRole (what the app can do with documents of this type).  In the
AppList cache, I generate a dictionary, keyed by file extension, whose
values are the dictionaries containing the NSTypes dictionaries of each
of the apps that handle the extension.

I tested the code briefly with the FileViewer app, and it seemed to
provide the icons as expected.

With this model the software doesn't need to monitor loads of
different files, just register to recieve notifications when the
defaults database changes, and check an appropriate default value.  At
present, there are four hidden files used by the software:

@table @samp
@item ~/GNUstep/Services/.GNUstepAppList
	Cached information about applications and file extensions.
@item ~/GNUstep/Services/.GNUstepExtPrefs
	User preferences for which apps/icons should be used for each file
	extension.
@item ~/GNUstep/Services/.GNUstepServices
	Cache of services provides by apps and services daemons
@item ~/GNUstep/Services/.GNUstepDisabled
	User settings to determine which services should not appear in the
	services menu.
@end table 

Each of these is a serialized property list.

Almost forgot - Need to modify NSApplication to understand '-GSOpenFile ...'
as an instruction to open the specified file on launching.  Need to modify
NSWorkspace to supply the appropriate arguments when launching a task rather
than using the existing mechanism of using DO to request that the app opens
the file.  When these changes are made, we can turn any program into a
pseudo-GNUstep app by creating the appropriate app wrapper.
An app wrapper then need only contain a shell-script that understands the
-GSOpenFile argument and uses it to start the program - though provision of
a GNUstep-info.plist and various icons would obviously make things prettier.

For instance - you could set up xv.app to contain a shellscript 'xv' that
would start the real xv binary passing it a file to open if the -GSOpenFile
argument was given.  The Info-gnustep.plist file could look like this:

@example
@{
  NSExecutable = "xv";
  NSIcon = "xv.tiff";
  NSTypes = (
    @{
      NSIcon = "tiff.tiff";
      NSUnixExtensions = ( tiff, tif );
    @},
    @{
      NSIcon = "xbm.tiff";
      NSUnixExtensions = ( xbm );
    @}
  );
@}
@end example

@section Contributing

Contributing code is not difficult. Here are
some general guidelines:

@itemize @bullet

@item
FSF must maintain the right to accept or reject potential contributions.
Generally, the only reasons for rejecting contributions are cases where
they duplicate existing or nearly-released code, contain unremovable
specific machine dependencies, or are somehow incompatible with the
rest of the library. 

@item
Acceptance of contributions means that the code is accepted for adaptation
into libgnustep-gui.  FSF must reserve the right to make various editorial
changes in code. Very often, this merely entails formatting, maintenance of
various conventions, etc. Contributors are always given authorship credit and
shown the final version for approval.

@item
Contributors must assign their copyright to FSF via a form sent out
upon acceptance. Assigning copyright to FSF ensures that the code
may be freely distributed.

@item
Assistance in providing documentation, test files, and debugging
support is strongly encouraged.

@end itemize

Extensions, comments, and suggested modifications of existing libgnustep-gui
features are also very welcome.
