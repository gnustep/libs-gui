Installation
************

Introduction
============

   This file documents the installation of the GNUstep GUI Library,
`gnustep-gui'. If you are installing this package as part of the
GNUstep core package, read the file GNUstep-HOWTO for more complete
instructions on how to install the entire GNUstep package (including
this library).  GNUstep-HOWTO is located at <www.gnustep.org>

   You must have installed gnustep-base before building this library.

Configuration
=============

   Configuration is performed by running the `configure' program at a
shell prompt. You may want to use some of the optional arguments to the
`configure' program. Type `configure --help' for a list. GNUstep
specific options are at the end of this list (if any).

Compilation
===========

   To compile this library, type make. After this is complete, type make
install (make sure you are the root user). Some additional options you
can use with make are `debug=yes' to make a debugging version of the
library and `shared=no' to make a static version of the library. See
the gstep-make package for more information on these options.

Installing
==========

   To install, type
