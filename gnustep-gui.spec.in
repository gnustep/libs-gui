%description 
The GNUstep gui Library is a powerful library of graphical user interface
classes written completely in the Objective-C language; the classes are based
on Cocoa (formerly OPENSTEP), and provide the user with a themable environment.
While the default look and feel resembles NeXTSTEP, this can be changed.  
The classes include graphical objects such as windows, menus, buttons, 
text fields, popup lists, browsers, scrollviews, splitviews, fonts, colors, 
images, events, pasteboards,... This package includes development headers too.  
You need the corresponding backend library package (gnustep-back) to use 
this package.
