    <heading>The theme management system</heading>
    <p>
      The theme management system for the GNUstep GUI is based around the
      [GSTheme] class, which provides support for loading of theme bundles
      and methods for drawing common user interface elements.<br />
      The theme system works in conjunction with a variety of other GUI
      classes and is intended to eventually allow for very major changes
      in GUI appearance and behavior.
    </p>
    <p>
      Various design imperatives apply to the theme system, but probably
      the key ones are:
    </p>
    <list>
      <item>It should allow designers and other non-technical users to
        easily develop new and interesting GUI styles likely to attract
	new users to GNUstep.
      </item>
      <item>Using and switching between themes should be an easy and
        pleasant experience ... so that people are not put off when they
        try using themes.
      </item>
      <item>It should eventually permit a GNUstep application to
        appear as a native application on ms-windows and other systems.
      </item>
    </list>
    <p>
      To attain these aims implies the recognition of some more specific
      objectives and some possible technical solutions:
    </p>
    <list>
      <item>We must have as simple as possible an API for the
        functions handling the way GUI elements work and the way they
	draw themselves.<br />
	The standard OpenStep/MacOS-X API provides mechanisms for
	controlling the colors used to draw controls (via [NSColor] and
	[NSColorList]) and controlling the way controls behave
	(NSInterfaceStyleForKey() and [NSResponder-interfaceStyle]),
	but we need to extend that with methods to draw controls entirely
	differently if required.
      </item>
      <item>We must have a GUI application for theme development.
        It is not sufficient to provide an API if we want good graphic
	designers and user interface specialists to develop themes
	for us.
      </item>
      <item>It must be possible for an application to dynamically change
        the theme in use while it is running and it should be easy for a
	user to select between available themes.<br />
	This implies that themes must be loadable bundles and that it
	must always be possible to unload a theme as well as loading one.<br />
	It suggests that the theme selection mechanism should be in every
	application, perhaps as an extension to an existing panel such
	as the info panel.
      </item>
    </list>
    <section>
      <heading>Types of theming</heading>
      <p>
        There are various aspects of theming which can be treated pretty
	much separately, so there is no reason why a theme might not be
	created which just employs one of these mechanisms.
      </p>
      <deflist>
	<term>System images</term>
	<desc>
	  Possibly the simples theme change ... a theme might supply a
	  new set of system images used for arrows and other icons that
	  the GUI decorates controls with.
	</desc>
        <term>System colors</term>
	<desc>
	  A theme might simply define a new system color list, so that
	  controls are drawn in a new color range, though they would
	  still function the same way.  Even specifying new colors can
	  make the GUI look quite different though.<br />
	  Beyond system colors, the theming API also provides a mechanism
	  for specifying colors for particular parts of GUI controls.
	</desc>
	<term>Image tiling</term>
	<desc>
	  Controls might be given sets of images used as tiling to draw
	  themselves rather than using the standard line drawing and
	  color fill mechanisms.
	</desc>
	<term>Interface style</term>
	<desc>
	  A theme might supply a set of interface style keys for various
	  controls, defining how those controls should behave subject to
	  the limitation of the range of behaviors coded into the GUI
	  library.
	</desc>
	<term>Method override</term>
	<desc>
	  A theme might actually provide code, in the form of a subclass
	  of [GSTheme] such that drawing methods have completely custom
	  behavior.
	</desc>
      </deflist>
    </section>

    <section>
      <heading>Subclassing GSTheme</heading>
      <p>
	While many themes can be created without subclassing GSTheme,
	there are some cases where writing code is necessary (most
	notably when interfacing to a native theming engine for some
	platform in order to make a GNUstep app have a native look).<br />
	In these cases the subclass should follow certain rules in order
	to operate cleanly and efficiently:
      </p>
      <deflist>
	<term>Stability</term>
	<desc>
	  Theme operation should remain consistent while it is in use,
	  particularly in the provision of resources such as images and
	  colors.<br />
	  If a theme needs to change a resource (such as an image) then
	  it should do so by calling -deactivate, making the change, and
	  then calling -activate.  This sequence ensures that the GUI
	  library is made aware of any changes and can redraw the screen.<br />
	  The deactivation/activation sequence is expensive, so the
	  subclass should attempt to combine multiple resource updates
	  into a group rather than performing the deactivation/activation
	  for each resource individually.
	</desc>
        <term>Activation</term>
	<desc>
	  The standard -activate method replaces existing system images,
	  colors, interface style settings and other user defaults settings
	  with versions stored in the theme bundle.<br />
	  If a subclass wishes to dynamically provide these resources rather
	  than supplying them as static information in the bundle, it may
	  update the in-memory information after the normal operation has
	  taken place.  This should be done by the theme registering itsself
	  as an observer of GSThemeWillActivateNotification and adding the
	  resources just before the theme becomes active.<br />
	  Cleanup may be done in response to a GSThemeWillDeactivateNotification
	  (called before the default cleanup) or a
	  GSThemeDidDeactivateNotification (called after the default cleanup).
	</desc>
        <term>Versioning</term>
	<desc>
	  With a theme which contains only static resources, versioning is
	  not much of an issue, but with a code-based theme (ie where you
	  subclass GSTheme) versioning does become very important.  This is
	  because, while you can load code from a bundle, you can't unload
	  it again ... so if you have two versions of a theme where the
	  subclass has the same name, then you have a conflict and can't
	  load both and swap between the two.<br />
	  Thematic.app solves this problem my incorporating a version number
	  into the name of the GSTheme subclasses it creates, but that's
	  not the only consideration...<br />
	  You must also ensure that either you do not define any other
	  classes in your theme or that, if you do define them you make
	  sure that each of them incorporates the theme version number.<br />
	  A similar consideration would apply to any categories, however
	  category conflicts are far more difficult to resolve since
	  even with different version names of the categories, the
	  categories all effect the same class/methods.  In fact this
	  issue is so tricky to deal with that you should simply not
	  use categories within your theme code.<br />
	  To work around this limitation, the GSTheme class supports
	  overriding of the methods of any other class while the theme
	  is active.  See the -overriddenMethod:for: method for more
	  information.
	</desc>
	<term>Image override</term>
	<desc>
	  System images (those returned by the [NSImage+imageNamed:] method)
	  are handled by the default theming mechanism, for each system image
	  supplied in the theme bundle, the image is loaded from the bundle
	  and used while the theme is active.  Any pre-existing in-memory image
	  is saved on theme activation and restored on theme deactivation.<br />
	  A theme subclass may override the -imageClass method to change the
	  class used to load each image from the bundle ... thus allowing
	  customisation of not just the images but also of the image
	  behavior in the (very rare) cases where this is desirable.<br />
          Finally, a theme may provide application specific images which are
          loaded <em>in preference to</em> named images from the application's
          own bundle.  These images are simply stored in a subdirectory whose
          name is the same as the application's bundleIdentifier.

  <p><em>This interface is <strong>HIGHLY</strong> unstable

  </p>
  <p>
  This is a class used for 'theming', which is mostly a matter of
  encapsulating common drawing behaviors so that GUI appearance can
  be easily modified, but also includes mechanisms for altering
  some GUI behavior (such as orientation and position of menus).
  </p>
  <p>
  Methods in this class standardize drawing of buttons, borders
  and other common GUI elements, so that all other classes within
  the GUI will provide a consistent appearance by using these
  methods.
  </p>
  <p>
  The default implementation uses the standard configurable colors
  defined in NSColor, such as <code>controlLightHighlightColor</code>,
  <code>controlShadowColor</code> and <code>controlDarkShadowColor</code>.<br />
  Themes are expected to override the default system color list with their
  own versions, and this class cooperates with [NSColor] and [NSColorList]
  to establish the correct system color list when a theme is activated.
  </p>
  <p>
  The class provides a mechanism for automatic loading of theme bundles
  consisting of resources used to define how drawing is done, plus an
  optional binary subclass of this class (to replace/extend the drawing
  methods this class provides).
  </p>
  <p>
  In future this class should provide mechanisms to draw controls by
  tiling of images, and provide control over GUI behavior by controlling
  the values returned by NSInterfaceStyleForKey() so that controls
  use the appropriate behavior.
