/**
 * <title>NSController</title>
 * <abstract>Abstract base class for controllers in the Model-View-Controller architecture</abstract>
 * NSController is an abstract base class that provides the foundational infrastructure
 * for controller objects in Cocoa's Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture.
 * It serves as the superclass for concrete controller classes like NSObjectController,
 * NSArrayController, and NSTreeController.
 *
 * Key responsibilities include:
 * - Managing editing sessions and editor registration
 * - Providing a common interface for model-view communication
 * - Handling commit and discard operations for pending changes
 * - Supporting the NSEditor and NSEditorRegistration protocols
 * - Enabling Key-Value Observing (KVO) integration
 * - Managing declared keys for automatic observation
 *
 * NSController implements the NSEditor protocol to participate in editing
 * hierarchies, allowing controllers to be composed and managed by other controllers.
 * It also implements NSEditorRegistration to manage child editors that are
 * editing the controller's content.
 *
 * Subclasses should override the abstract methods to provide specific behavior
 * for their particular model management strategies. The base class provides
 * the infrastructure for tracking active editors and coordinating editing
 * operations across the controller hierarchy.
