/**
 * <title>NSCustomImageRep</title>
 * <abstract>Custom image representation using delegate drawing</abstract>
 *
 * NSCustomImageRep provides a flexible way to create custom image representations
 * by delegating the actual drawing to another object. Instead of storing bitmap
 * data or vector graphics internally, this image representation calls a specified
 * method on a delegate object whenever the image needs to be drawn.
 *
 * This approach is particularly useful for creating dynamic images that are
 * generated programmatically, images that depend on current state or context,
 * or images that are too complex or memory-intensive to pre-render and cache.
 * The delegate-based drawing allows for real-time generation and infinite
 * scalability since the drawing is performed at render time.
 *
 * The delegate object must implement a drawing method that takes the custom
 * image representation as its parameter. This method is responsible for
 * performing all the drawing operations needed to render the image content
 * within the current graphics context.
 *
 * NSCustomImageRep integrates seamlessly with NSImage and the broader image
 * system, allowing custom-drawn content to be used anywhere standard image
 * representations can be used, including in image views, buttons, and other
 * graphical elements.

/**

 * method should perform all necessary drawing operations to render the image
 * content within the current graphics context.
 *
 * The aSelector parameter specifies the method to call on the delegate for drawing.
 * This method should take the NSCustomImageRep instance as its single parameter
 * and should not return a value. The anObject parameter specifies the delegate
 * object that will handle the drawing operations.
 *
 * The delegate object is not retained by the custom image representation, so the
 * caller must ensure the delegate remains valid for the lifetime of the image rep.
 * Returns a newly initialized custom image representation configured with the
 * specified delegate and drawing selector.
