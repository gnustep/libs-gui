/**
 * <title>NSCursor</title>
 * <abstract>Encapsulates mouse cursor appearance and behavior</abstract>
 * NSCursor represents the visual appearance and behavior of the mouse cursor.
 * It combines an image with a hot spot that defines the precise location within
 * the image that corresponds to the cursor's position. NSCursor manages a stack
 * of active cursors and provides methods for showing, hiding, and tracking
 * cursor changes throughout the application.
 *
 * Key features include:
 * - Custom cursor creation from images with specified hot spots
 * - Predefined system cursors for common operations
 * - Cursor stack management with push/pop operations
 * - Automatic cursor changes on mouse enter/exit events
 * - System-wide cursor hiding and visibility control
 * - Support for foreground and background color hints
 *
 * NSCursor maintains a cursor stack where cursors can be pushed and popped,
 * allowing temporary cursor changes that automatically revert to previous
 * cursors. The class also provides numerous predefined cursors for standard
 * operations like text selection, resizing, and drag-and-drop operations.
 *
 * Cursor changes can be tied to mouse tracking events, automatically switching
 * cursors when the mouse enters or exits specific regions. The system can also
 * hide the cursor until the mouse moves, useful for fullscreen applications
 * or media players.
