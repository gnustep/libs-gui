    <abstract>Interface Builder annotation macros and declarations</abstract>

    This header provides macro definitions and declarations used by Interface
    Builder and other visual development tools to annotate Objective-C code
    for automatic user interface construction and connection.

    The primary macros defined here are:
    * IBOutlet - Marks instance variables as outlets for interface connections
    * IBAction - Marks methods as actions that can be connected to UI controls

    These macros serve as annotations that are recognized by Interface Builder
    when parsing header files to identify properties and methods that should
    be available for visual connection in the interface design process.

    While these macros expand to empty declarations at compile time (except
    for IBAction which expands to void), they provide crucial metadata for
    development tools that generate and maintain user interface connections.
