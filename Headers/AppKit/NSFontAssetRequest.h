 *
 * NSFontAssetRequest provides a mechanism for downloading font assets that are
 * not currently available on the local system. This is particularly useful for
 * applications that need to access fonts that may be available through system
 * font downloading services or cloud-based font libraries.
 *
 * The class manages the entire download process, including progress tracking,
 * error handling, and notification when fonts become available. It supports
 * downloading multiple fonts simultaneously and provides completion handlers
 * for asynchronous notification of download status.
 *
 * Font asset requests are created with an array of font descriptors that
 * specify the desired fonts, along with options that control the download
 * behavior and user interface presentation. The download process is
 * asynchronous and non-blocking, allowing applications to continue normal
 * operation while fonts are being retrieved.
