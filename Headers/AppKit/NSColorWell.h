/**
 * <title>NSColorWell</title>
 * <abstract>Interactive color selection control for single color values</abstract>
 * NSColorWell provides a simple, compact interface for displaying and selecting
 * colors within applications. It appears as a rectangular well that displays
 * the current color and allows users to click to open the system color panel
 * for color selection.
 *
 * Key features include:
 * * Visual color display with customizable border appearance
 * * Integration with the system color panel for color selection
 * * Drag-and-drop color support for easy color sharing
 * * Activation/deactivation states for color panel interaction
 * * Target-action pattern for color change notifications
 * * Automatic color well management and exclusivity handling
 * * Support for both bordered and borderless display styles
 * * Full integration with Interface Builder and archiving
 *
 * Color wells can be activated to connect with the shared color panel,
 * allowing users to select new colors through the full range of system
 * color pickers. The well automatically manages its activation state and
 * ensures only one color well is active at a time when exclusive activation
 * is used.
 *
 * The control supports standard target-action patterns, sending action
 * messages when the color changes. Color wells also participate in the
 * responder chain and can take colors from other controls that implement
 * the color sharing protocol.
 *
 * Visual appearance can be customized with bordered or borderless styles,
 * making color wells suitable for various interface designs from utility
 * panels to integrated application interfaces.
