/**
 * <title>NSDatePicker</title>
 * <abstract>A control for selecting dates and times</abstract>
 *
 * NSDatePicker provides an interactive user interface for selecting dates and times.
 * It can display various combinations of date and time elements (day, month, year,
 * hour, minute, second) and supports different presentation styles including text
 * fields, stepper controls, and graphical calendars.
 *
 * The date picker can be configured to operate in different modes, such as showing
 * only dates, only times, or both dates and times together. It supports localization
 * for different calendar systems, time zones, and cultural date/time formatting
 * conventions.
 *
 * Date pickers can enforce minimum and maximum date constraints, making them suitable
 * for applications that need to restrict date selection to valid ranges. They integrate
 * with the target-action pattern like other NSControl subclasses, sending actions
 * when the selected date or time changes.
 *
 * The control supports various visual styles and can be customized with background
 * colors, text colors, borders, and bezeled appearances to match application design
 * requirements.
