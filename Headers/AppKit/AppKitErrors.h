/** <title>AppKitErrors</title>

    <abstract>Error constants and domains for AppKit operations</abstract>

    This header defines error domains, error codes, and related constants
    used throughout the AppKit framework for error reporting and handling.
    It provides standardized error information for common AppKit operations
    such as document loading, printing, image processing, and user interface
    operations.

    The error constants defined here are compatible with NSError and provide
    localized error descriptions for various failure conditions that can
    occur during AppKit operations.
