/**
 * <title>NSColorPicker</title>
 * <abstract>Abstract superclass for custom color picker implementations</abstract>
 * NSColorPicker serves as the abstract base class for implementing custom color
 * selection interfaces within NSColorPanel. It provides the foundational
 * framework for creating specialized color pickers that integrate seamlessly
 * with the system color panel.
 *
 * Key responsibilities include:
 * * Integration with NSColorPanel through the NSColorPickingDefault protocol
 * * Button image management for color picker mode selection
 * * Color list attachment and management for predefined color collections
 * * Response to alpha transparency control changes
 * * Adaptive layout handling for view size changes
 * * Mode switching and configuration management
 *
 * Subclasses must implement the NSColorPickingDefault protocol methods to
 * provide the actual color selection interface and behavior. The base class
 * handles the common infrastructure including panel integration, button
 * management, and standard notifications.
 *
 * Color pickers are typically instantiated by the color panel system based
 * on available picker masks and user preferences. Each picker represents
 * a distinct color selection method (RGB sliders, color wheel, CMYK controls,
 * etc.) and maintains its own interface state and color selection logic.
 *
 * The picker system supports dynamic reconfiguration including alpha control
 * visibility changes and view resizing, allowing pickers to adapt their
 * interface to changing requirements and panel configurations.
