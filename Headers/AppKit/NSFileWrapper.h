/**
 * <title>NSFileWrapper (AppKit)</title>
 * <abstract>AppKit access to Foundation's file wrapper functionality</abstract>
 *
 * This header provides AppKit applications with access to NSFileWrapper,
 * which is primarily defined in Foundation. NSFileWrapper objects hold
 * a file's contents in dynamic memory and provide a convenient way to
 * work with files and directories as objects.
 *
 * In the context of AppKit applications, NSFileWrapper is commonly used
 * with document-based applications, drag and drop operations, and anywhere
 * file system entities need to be represented as objects. The class
 * supports files, directories, and symbolic links, providing a unified
 * interface for manipulating file system structures.
 *
 * Key capabilities include:
 * - Reading files and directories into memory
 * - Creating new file wrappers programmatically
 * - Writing file wrappers back to the file system
 * - Maintaining file attributes and metadata
 * - Supporting nested directory structures
 * - Handling symbolic links appropriately
 *
 * For document-based applications, NSFileWrapper provides an excellent
 * foundation for implementing document packages (bundles) and complex
 * document formats that consist of multiple files and directories.
 *
 * The complete interface and documentation for NSFileWrapper can be
 * found in Foundation/NSFileWrapper.h. AppKit-specific extensions,
 * if any, are provided through categories defined elsewhere in the
 * AppKit framework.
